# Brianna's Portfolio
## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Work Done
This challenge involved creating a portfolio to display my work as a web developer.
I used html and css to create this webpage.
I added pictures to the portfolio. The first is of a deployed webpage from our last challenge.
The remainder of the pictures serve as placeholder where I will later upload
screenshots of future work to add to the porfolio.
I included a brief description of myself and my goals. I used CSS to add styling 
such as positioning, background colors, assign fonts, create hover effects, 
link sections of the page, and link external webpages. For more information, 
please refer to the notes within the webpages code.
